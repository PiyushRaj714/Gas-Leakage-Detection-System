The working of this sensor is very simple. Actually,
it measures the resistance between two probes.
There is a heater that heats up the sensor a little and then checks resistance.
When the sensor come in contact with LPG gas, its resistance changes between the two probes of the sensor and hence gives 5V on the output pin. 
this IoT project comes under the security project for homes.
Due to some limitations,
it causes some delay in the sensor also distance is a big factor in determining the value so try to keep the sensor in contact with the source. Not this much that it can cause accidents, but at a minimum distance.
